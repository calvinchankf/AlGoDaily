    3rd approach: dynamic programming, kadan's algorithm
    - for each item, store the max either itself or extend the previous sum with itself
      e.g. dp[i] chooses between dp[i-1]+nums[i] and nums[i]
    - the result is the largest dp[i]
    - optimize the 2nd approach by using store one variable for dp array cos for each item
    we just need to compare with previous item result

    followups:
    - print the max sum subarray
    - what if circular
