"""
    1st approach: recursion
    - when we do recursion to slice candidates, we can check there are any palindromes from start to i, s[:i+1]
    - if yes, we can do the next recusion starting from i+1

    e.g. abcdcbe

    when it comes to the first b, the palindromes from the b are
    b
    bcdcb

    when it comes to the c, the palindromes from the c are
    c
    cdc

    Time    O(n * 2^n) the worst case all characters are the same, so for each character we can split or contain
    Space   O(n) the depth of the recursion tree
