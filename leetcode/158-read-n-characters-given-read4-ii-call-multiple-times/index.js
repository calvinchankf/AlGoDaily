    1st: use js closure
    - bad description
    - in short, lets say we want to read the first 5 characters from "leetcode" using read4()

    1. when we call read4(interanlBuffer), interanlBuffer = [l, e, e, t]
    so then we push all 4 items from interanlBuffer to our result by buf.push()

    2. when we call read4(interanlBuffer), interanlBuffer = [c, o, d, e]
    since we only need 1 more character, we only have to push the "c" into buff

    As a result,
    interanlBuffer = [o, d, e]
    buff = [l, e, e, t, c]

    Time    O(N)
    Space   O(4)
    80 ms, faster than 45.87%
