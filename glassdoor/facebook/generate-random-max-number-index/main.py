    Given an array of integers arr, randomly return an index of the maximum value seen by far.

    Example:
    Input: [11, 30, 2, 30, 30, 30, 6, 2, 62, 62]

     0   1   2  3   4   5   6  7  8   9
    [11, 30, 2, 30, 30, 30, 6, 2, 62, 62]

    idx0: 11 is largest, indices are [0]
    idx1: 30 is largest, indices are [1]
    idx2: 30 is largest, indices are [1]
    idx3: 30 is largest, indices are [1,3], pick either one of them
    idx4: 30 is largest, indices are [1,3,4], pick one of them
    idx5: 30 is largest, indices are [1,3,4,5], pick one of them
    idx6: 30 is largest, indices are [1,3,4,5], pick one of them
    idx7: 30 is largest, indices are [1,3,4,5], pick one of them
    idx8: 62 is largest, indices are [8]
    idx9: 62 is largest, indices are [8,9], pick either one of them


    Having iterated up to the at element index 5 (where the last 30 is), randomly give an index among [1, 3, 4, 5] which are indices of 30 - the max value by far. Each index should have a 1/4 chance to get picked.

    Having iterated through the entire array, randomly give an index between 8 and 9 which are indices of the max value 62.
