    3rd approach: Reservoir Sampling
    - for an unknown size array or data stream, we can do Reservoir Sampling such that we dont need to store the size of the array initially
    e.g. [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,.......]

    calculation of probability: selected * notselected * notselected * notselected..... * notselected

    Therefore...!!!
    the prob of x1 = 1/1 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 * ..... * (n-1)/n = 1/n
    the prob of x2 = 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 * ..... * (n-1)/n = 1/n
    the prob of x3 = 1/3 * 3/4 * ..... * (n-1)/n = 1/n
    ...
    the prob of x(n-1) = 1/(n-1) * (n-1)/n = 1/n
    the prob of xn = 1/n = 1/n
