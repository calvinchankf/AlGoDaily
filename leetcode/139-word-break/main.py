"""
    1st approach: recursion + memorization + slice max length
    
    - e.g. "catsandogab", ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat", "og", "ab"]
    from the begining, we can split it into 2 strings
    [cat,sandogab], [cats, andogab]
    then they can become in the next recursion
    [cat,sand,ogab], [cat,sand,ogab]
    then 
    [cat,sand,og,ab], [cat,sand,og,ab]
    
    - actually we did [cat,sand,ogab], we know that "ogab" is breakable after the recursion,
    therefore we can save "ogab" as "true" so that we can avoid redundant computation if we meet "ogab" again

    Time    O(n^2)
    Space   O(n)
    16 ms, faster than 99.95%
