- we need to have a stack to store the previous block that we seen along the way
- when we see an integer, pile up the stack and the score
- when we see a Z, we need to pop the stack
- when we see a X, we peak the top item in the stack and add item*2 to the stack
- when we see a +, we comput the score by adding the prevously 2 items from the stack
    here, i am not sure if the stack size will be legit along the iteration, so i just add one item if len(stack) < 2
- the result is the sum of the stack items

Time    O(N)
Space   O(N)
